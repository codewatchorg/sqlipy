<p>This extension integrates Burp Suite with SQLMap.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jython 2.7.0 or newer</li>
        <li>Java 1.7 or 1.8 (the beta version of Jython 2.7 requires this).</li>
	<li>Python 2 (already installed on most Unix distributions)</li>
</ul>

<p>SQLMap is embedded within the extension; it will be automatically configured, so you can click <i>Start API</i>.
In some cases you may need to manually adjust the configuration or run the SQLMap API manually.</p>

<p>Once the SQLMap API is running, you just need to right-click in the 'Request' 
sub tab of either the Target or Proxy main tabs and choose 'SQLiPy Scan' from 
the context menu.
This will populate the SQLMap Scanner tab with information about that request.  Clicking the 'Start Scan' button will execute a scan.</p>

<p>If the page is vulnerable to SQL injection, then these will be added to the Scanner Results tab.
