<p>This extension integrates Burp Suite with SQLMap.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jython 2.7 beta, due to the use of json.</li>
    <li>Java 1.7 or 1.8 (the beta version of Jython 2.7 requires this).</li>
	<li>A running instance of the SQLMap API server.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQLMap comes with a RESTful based server that will execute SQLMap scans. You can manually start the server 
with: </p>
<pre> python sqlmapapi.py -s -H &lt;ip&gt; -p &lt;port&gt;
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the SQLMap API tab to select the IP/Port on which to run, as well as the path to python and sqlmapapi.py on your system.

</p>
<p>Once the SQLMap API is running, you just need to right-click in the 'Request' 
sub tab of either the Target or Proxy main tabs and choose 'SQLiPy Scan' from 
the context menu.

This will populate the SQLMap Scanner tab with information about that request.  Clicking the 'Start Scan' button will execute a scan.

If the page is vulnerable to SQL injection, then these will be added to the Scanner Results tab.
